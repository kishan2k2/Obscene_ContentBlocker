# Obscene_ContentBlocker
A small project for reckon Hackathon
# Problem statement

1. Obscene content blocker
2. **Description** Design and develop a technological solution for identifying and blocking any obscene media (image/video/audio) at the user’s end. The solution should be able to send alerts to the concerned nodal agency in case of the spread of such content. The solution may be in the form of a desktop/mobile application or a web browser plugin.

# Solution/Idea/Approach Detail

1. We will build a browser extension that will either display the content of the website or block it using the following metrics.
    1. Using the URL of the website.
        1. Check if has already been blacklisted.
        2. Monitoring and analyzing the content of the website using machine learning and data science. 
2. **Our solution is tried and tested and gives astonishing 93.88 accuracy**

# Usecase

- Parental Control:
    
    Scenario: Parents want to ensure a safe online environment for their children.
    Use Case: The browser extension helps parents filter and block explicit content, ensuring a child-friendly browsing experience.
    

- Corporate Security:
    
    Scenario: Organizations aim to maintain a safe and secure working environment.
    Use Case: The extension helps organizations block access to inappropriate content, fostering a professional and secure workplace.
    

- Public Spaces:
    
    Scenario: Public places with shared computers (libraries, internet cafes) need to prevent access to explicit content.
    Use Case: The extension helps maintain a safe browsing environment in public spaces, adhering to community standards.
    

- Institutional Compliance:
    
    Scenario: Organizations need to comply with regulations regarding inappropriate content.
    Use Case: The extension helps organizations meet compliance standards by actively blocking and reporting explicit content.
    

- Individual User Control:
    
    Scenario: Users want to customize their online experience and avoid specific types of content.
    Use Case: The extension allows users to define their content preferences, blocking or allowing websites based on their personal choices.
    

- Customized Safe Browsing Experience:
    
    Scenario: Users prefer a tailored browsing experience with personalized content filtering.
    Use Case: The extension offers personalization options, allowing users to define specific criteria for safe or unsafe content based on their preferences.
    

# FutureScope

- **Advanced Machine Learning Models:**
    - Explore the integration of more advanced machine learning models for content classification, such as deep learning models or transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for enhanced accuracy.
- **Multimedia Content Analysis:**
    - Extend the solution to include analysis of multimedia content, such as images and audio. Implementing image and audio recognition models can contribute to a more comprehensive content filtering system.
- **User Behavior Analysis:**
    - Incorporate user behavior analysis to enhance content classification. Understanding patterns in user behavior can contribute to more accurate predictions and personalized content filtering.
- **Real-time Alerts and Reporting:**
    - Implement real-time alerts for users and nodal agencies, enhancing the immediacy of response to potentially harmful content. Develop detailed reporting mechanisms for nodal agencies to facilitate timely intervention.
